Bitcoin Surges Past $75,000 - New All-Time High

Market Analysis:
Bitcoin has reached a historic milestone, breaking through the $75,000 
resistance level with strong momentum. This surge is attributed to:

• Institutional Adoption: Major financial institutions including BlackRock 
  and Fidelity have increased their Bitcoin holdings by 23% this quarter
• Regulatory Clarity: The SEC's recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has 
  brought unprecedented legitimacy to the crypto market
• Supply Dynamics: With the upcoming halving event in 6 months, miners 
  are reducing sell pressure, creating a supply squeeze

AI Insight for Investors:
This breakout represents a significant shift in market sentiment. Long-term 
holders (addresses holding for 1+ years) now control 68% of circulating 
supply, the highest level since 2020. Historical patterns suggest this 
accumulation phase typically precedes extended bull markets.

Key Metrics:
📊 Price: $75,234 (+12.4% 24h)
📈 Volume: $48.2B (+156%)
💰 Market Cap: $1.47T
🔥 Fear & Greed Index: 78 (Extreme Greed)

Investment Perspective:
For long-term investors, this could be an early stage of a multi-year bull 
cycle. Consider dollar-cost averaging rather than lump-sum entries at these 
elevated levels. Watch for pullbacks to $68K-$70K range for better entry points.
