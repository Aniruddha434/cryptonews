# üåê Multi-Source News Integration

**Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented  
**Date**: 2025-10-18

---

## üìã Overview

The Telegram News Bot now aggregates crypto news from **3 major sources** instead of just CryptoPanic:

1. **CryptoPanic** - Community-voted important/hot news
2. **CryptoCompare** - Professional crypto news aggregator
3. **CoinGecko** - Community-driven crypto news platform

This provides **much better news coverage** and reduces dependency on a single source.

---

## üéØ Benefits

### **1. Increased News Coverage**
- **3x more news sources** = more breaking news detected
- **Diverse perspectives** from different platforms
- **Redundancy** - if one API is down, others still work

### **2. Better Quality Filtering**
- Each source has its own importance scoring algorithm
- Cross-validation from multiple sources
- Community engagement metrics (votes, upvotes)

### **3. Faster Breaking News Detection**
- CryptoCompare: Real-time news aggregation
- CoinGecko: Community-curated breaking news
- CryptoPanic: Community-voted important news

---

## üìä News Sources Comparison

| Source | Type | Cost | Rate Limit | Strengths |
|--------|------|------|------------|-----------|
| **CryptoPanic** | Community | Free | Unlimited | Community voting, hot/important flags |
| **CryptoCompare** | Professional | Free tier | 50k calls/month | High-quality aggregation, engagement metrics |
| **CoinGecko** | Community | Free | Unlimited | Curated news, no API key needed |

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### **Step 1: Get CryptoCompare API Key (Optional)**

CryptoCompare works without an API key, but having one gives you higher rate limits.

1. Go to: https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Get your API key from the dashboard
4. Add to `.env`:

```bash
CRYPTOCOMPARE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**Free Tier Limits**:
- 50,000 calls/month
- ~1,666 calls/day
- More than enough for checking every 5 minutes (288 calls/day)

---

### **Step 2: Update .env File**

Your `.env` should now have:

```bash
# News APIs
NEWSAPI_KEY=3e6da067396c4e82b21cb0ecfcbf37a3
CRYPTOPANIC_API_KEY=33cba4c0c1d59be4c14fcdcdc86335f45223befd
CRYPTOCOMPARE_API_KEY=  # Optional: Add your key here
```

**Note**: CoinGecko doesn't need an API key!

---

### **Step 3: Restart the Bot**

```bash
python bot.py
```

**Expected Log Output**:
```
üî• Fetching hot/important news from ALL sources for real-time posting...
   ‚úÖ CryptoPanic: 3 hot articles
   ‚úÖ CryptoCompare: 2 hot articles
   ‚úÖ CoinGecko: 1 hot articles
üéØ Total unique hot articles from all sources: 6
   üìä Breakdown: CryptoPanic=3, CryptoCompare=2, CoinGecko=1
```

---

## üìä How It Works

### **News Aggregation Flow**

```
Every 5 minutes:
  ‚îú‚îÄ Fetch from CryptoPanic (filter=important)
  ‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Score based on: important flag, hot flag, votes
  ‚îÇ
  ‚îú‚îÄ Fetch from CryptoCompare (latest news)
  ‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Score based on: upvotes, categories, engagement
  ‚îÇ
  ‚îú‚îÄ Fetch from CoinGecko (curated news)
  ‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Score based on: recency, curation quality
  ‚îÇ
  ‚îú‚îÄ Deduplicate by URL (remove duplicates)
  ‚îÇ
  ‚îú‚îÄ Sort by importance score (highest first)
  ‚îÇ
  ‚îî‚îÄ Post articles with score ‚â• 5/10
```

---

## üß™ Testing

### **Test 1: Verify All Sources Working**

Run the bot and check logs for:
```
‚úÖ CryptoPanic: X hot articles
‚úÖ CryptoCompare: X hot articles
‚úÖ CoinGecko: X hot articles
```

If any source shows `‚ùå`, check the error message.

---

### **Test 2: Use /testnews Command**

```
/testnews
```

The bot will now fetch from all 3 sources and post the highest-importance article.

**Check the posted message** - it should show which source it came from in the logs:
```
üî• POSTING hot news (score: 8/10): Bitcoin surges...
   Source API: CryptoCompare
```

---

### **Test 3: Monitor Real-Time Posting**

Watch the logs for the next 15-30 minutes. You should see:

1. **More news articles detected** (3 sources vs 1)
2. **Better diversity** in news topics
3. **Faster breaking news** detection

---

## üìà Expected Improvements

### **Before (CryptoPanic only)**:
- ~3-5 hot articles per check
- Limited to CryptoPanic's curation
- Single point of failure

### **After (3 sources)**:
- ~6-15 hot articles per check
- Diverse news from multiple platforms
- Redundancy and reliability
- Better breaking news coverage

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **Issue: CryptoCompare returns 0 articles**

**Possible causes**:
1. API key invalid (if provided)
2. Rate limit exceeded (50k/month)
3. Network issue

**Solution**:
- Remove API key from `.env` to use without authentication
- Check CryptoCompare status: https://status.cryptocompare.com/
- The bot will still work with CryptoPanic and CoinGecko

---

### **Issue: CoinGecko returns 0 articles**

**Possible causes**:
1. CoinGecko API temporarily down
2. Network issue

**Solution**:
- Check CoinGecko status: https://status.coingecko.com/
- The bot will still work with CryptoPanic and CryptoCompare

---

### **Issue: All sources return 0 articles**

**Possible causes**:
1. No important crypto news at this moment
2. Network connectivity issue

**Solution**:
- Check your internet connection
- Wait 5-10 minutes for next check cycle
- Use `/testnews` to manually trigger a fetch

---

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### **Check Source Distribution**

Look for this in the logs:
```
üìä Breakdown: CryptoPanic=3, CryptoCompare=2, CoinGecko=1
```

**Healthy distribution**: All 3 sources contributing articles

**Unhealthy distribution**: Only 1 source working (check other sources)

---

### **Check Importance Scores**

```
[1] Score: 8/10 | Source: CryptoPanic | Hot: True | Important: True
[2] Score: 7/10 | Source: CryptoCompare | Upvotes: 45
[3] Score: 6/10 | Source: CoinGecko | Published: 30 min ago
```

**Good**: Scores distributed across 5-10 range  
**Bad**: All scores at 5 (threshold too low) or all at 10 (threshold too high)

---

## üéØ Optimization Tips

### **1. Adjust Importance Threshold**

If you're getting **too many posts**:
```bash
# In .env
MIN_IMPORTANCE_SCORE=6  # Increase from 5
```

If you're getting **too few posts**:
```bash
# In .env
MIN_IMPORTANCE_SCORE=4  # Decrease from 5
```

---

### **2. Prioritize Specific Sources**

Edit `news_fetcher.py` to boost scores for preferred sources:

```python
# Boost CryptoCompare articles
if article["news_source_api"] == "CryptoCompare":
    importance_score += 1  # Add bonus point
```

---

### **3. Filter by Categories**

Edit `fetch_cryptocompare_news()` to filter by specific categories:

```python
# Only include breaking news
if "Breaking" in article.get("categories", []):
    articles.append(article)
```
