# 🚀 Quick Setup: Multi-Source News Integration

## ⚡ TL;DR

Your bot now fetches news from **3 sources** instead of 1:
- ✅ CryptoPanic (already working)
- ✅ CryptoCompare (NEW - optional API key)
- ✅ CoinGecko (NEW - no API key needed)

---

## 🔧 Setup (2 minutes)

### **Option 1: Use Without CryptoCompare API Key (Easiest)**

Just restart the bot - it works immediately!

```bash
python bot.py
```

**Done!** The bot will use:
- CryptoPanic (with your existing key)
- CryptoCompare (without API key - limited but works)
- CoinGecko (no key needed)

---

### **Option 2: Add CryptoCompare API Key (Recommended)**

**Why?** Higher rate limits (50k calls/month vs limited)

**Steps**:

1. **Get free API key**: https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/
   - Sign up (free)
   - Copy your API key

2. **Add to .env**:
   ```bash
   CRYPTOCOMPARE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Restart bot**:
   ```bash
   python bot.py
   ```

**Done!**

## ✅ Verify It's Working

### **Check 1: Look for this in logs**

```
🔥 Fetching hot/important news from ALL sources for real-time posting...
   ✅ CryptoPanic: 3 hot articles
   ✅ CryptoCompare: 2 hot articles
   ✅ CoinGecko: 1 hot articles
🎯 Total unique hot articles from all sources: 6
```

**Good**: All 3 sources show ✅  
**Bad**: Any source shows ❌ (check error message)

---

### **Check 2: Use /testnews**

In your Telegram group:
```
/testnews
```

**Expected**: Bot posts news from one of the 3 sources

**Check logs** to see which source it came from:
```
Source API: CryptoCompare
```

---

## 📊 What You'll See

### **Before (1 source)**:
```
🔍 Starting hot news check cycle...
✅ Found 3 hot articles from CryptoPanic
```

### **After (3 sources)**:
```
🔍 Starting hot news check cycle...
🔥 Fetching hot/important news from ALL sources...
   ✅ CryptoPanic: 3 hot articles
   ✅ CryptoCompare: 2 hot articles
   ✅ CoinGecko: 1 hot articles
🎯 Total unique hot articles from all sources: 6
   📊 Breakdown: CryptoPanic=3, CryptoCompare=2, CoinGecko=1
```

---

## 🎯 Expected Results

- **More news detected** (3x coverage)
- **Faster breaking news** (multiple sources)
- **Better quality** (cross-validation)
- **More posts to groups** (more qualifying articles)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **CryptoCompare shows ❌**

**Solution**: Leave `CRYPTOCOMPARE_API_KEY` empty in `.env`
```bash
CRYPTOCOMPARE_API_KEY=  # Leave empty
```

The bot will work without it (just with lower rate limits).

---

### **CoinGecko shows ❌**

**Cause**: CoinGecko API might be temporarily down

**Solution**: Wait 5-10 minutes. The bot still works with the other 2 sources.

---

### **All sources show ❌**

**Cause**: Network issue or no important news

**Solution**: 
1. Check internet connection
2. Wait 5 minutes for next cycle
3. Use `/testnews` to manually test

---

## 📈 Optimization

### **Too many posts?**

Increase threshold in `.env`:
```bash
MIN_IMPORTANCE_SCORE=6  # Was 5
```

### **Too few posts?**

Decrease threshold in `.env`:
```bash
MIN_IMPORTANCE_SCORE=4  # Was 5
```

---

## 📝 Summary

**What you need to do**:
1. ✅ (Optional) Get CryptoCompare API key
2. ✅ Add key to `.env` (or leave empty)

4. ✅ Verify with `/testnews`

**What you get**:
- 🚀 3x more news sources
