## üöÄ How It Works

### Real-Time Posting Flow:

```
1. Bot starts ‚Üí Initializes real-time monitoring service
                ‚Üì
2. Every 5 minutes ‚Üí Fetches hot/important news from CryptoPanic
                ‚Üì
3. For each article ‚Üí Calculates importance score (0-10)
                ‚Üì
4. If score ‚â• 7 ‚Üí Checks if already posted (duplicate detection)
                ‚Üì
5. If new ‚Üí Posts to ALL active groups immediately
                ‚Üì
6. For each group ‚Üí AI analyzes market impact for trader type
                ‚Üì
7. Formatted message ‚Üí Posted with hot news indicator üî•
                ‚Üì
8. Repeat ‚Üí Continuous 24/7 monitoring
```

### Importance Scoring System:

| Factor | Points | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Important Flag | +5 | CryptoPanic marks as important |
| Hot Flag | +3 | CryptoPanic marks as hot/trending |
| High Votes (‚â•10) | +2 | Strong community engagement |
| Medium Votes (5-9) | +1 | Moderate engagement |
| **Total** | **0-10** | Final importance score |

**Default Threshold**: Only news with score ‚â• 7 is posted

## üìä Message Format

When hot news is posted, it looks like this:

```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Adjust Monitoring Frequency

Edit `.env`:
```env
NEWS_CHECK_INTERVAL_MINUTES=3  # Check every 3 minutes (more frequent)

```

### Adjust Importance Threshold

Edit `.env`:
```env
MIN_IMPORTANCE_SCORE=5  # Post more news (lower threshold)
MIN_IMPORTANCE_SCORE=8  # Post only very important news (higher threshold)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Bot Not Posting Hot News?

1. **Check if real-time posting is enabled**:
   ```env
   ENABLE_REALTIME_POSTING=true
   ```

2. **Check importance threshold**:
   ```env
   MIN_IMPORTANCE_SCORE=7  # Lower this to post more news
   ```

3. **Check bot logs**:
   ```
   üîç Checking for hot news...
   Found X hot articles
   ```

4. **Verify CryptoPanic API**:
   - API key is correct
   - API endpoint is `/api/developer/v2/posts/`

### Bot Posting Too Much?

1. **Increase importance threshold**:
   ```env
   MIN_IMPORTANCE_SCORE=8  # Only very important news
   ```

2. **Increase check interval**:
   ```env
   NEWS_CHECK_INTERVAL_MINUTES=10  # Check less frequently
   ```

### Bot Not Starting?

1. **Check for multiple instances**:
   - Error: "Conflict: terminated by other getUpdates request"
   - Solution: Kill other bot instances

2. **Check imports**:
   ```bash
   python -c "from services.realtime_news_service import RealtimeNewsService; print('OK')"
   ```
