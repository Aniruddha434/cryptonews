# Phase 7: Background Tasks - COMPLETE ✅

**Completion Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ All features implemented and tested

---

## 📋 Overview

Phase 7 implemented a comprehensive background task system that automatically monitors subscription and trial expiration, sends timely warnings, and manages the subscription lifecycle without manual intervention.

---

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. **SubscriptionCheckerService Created**
**File:** `services/subscription_checker_service.py` (416 lines)

**Core Features:**
- ✅ Daily subscription checking at 9:00 AM UTC
- ✅ Trial expiration monitoring
- ✅ Grace period management
- ✅ Automatic group disabling
- ✅ Event logging for all actions
- ✅ Metrics tracking

**Main Methods:**
1. `check_all_subscriptions()` - Master method that runs all checks
2. `check_trial_warnings()` - Sends warnings at 7, 3, 1 days before expiration
3. `check_expired_trials()` - Moves expired trials to grace period
4. `check_grace_period_warnings()` - Sends urgent warnings 1 day before grace period ends
5. `check_expired_subscriptions()` - Disables groups with expired subscriptions

**Helper Methods:**
- `_find_trials_expiring_on_date()` - Query trials expiring on specific date
- `_find_trials_expired_on_date()` - Query expired trials
- `_find_grace_periods_ending_on_date()` - Query grace periods ending soon
- `_find_grace_periods_expired_on_date()` - Query expired grace periods
- `_was_warning_sent_today()` - Prevent duplicate warnings
- `_was_grace_warning_sent_today()` - Prevent duplicate grace warnings

---

### 2. **Background Task Scheduler**

**File:** `bot.py`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added `subscription_checker_service` initialization
- ✅ Added `subscription_check_task` attribute
- ✅ Created `_run_subscription_checker()` method
- ✅ Integrated with bot startup/shutdown lifecycle

**Scheduler Logic:**
```python
async def _run_subscription_checker(self):
    while True:
        # Calculate next 9 AM UTC
        next_run = calculate_next_9am_utc()
        
        # Sleep until next run
        await asyncio.sleep(sleep_seconds)
        
        # Run all subscription checks
        await subscription_checker_service.check_all_subscriptions()
```

**Features:**
- Runs daily at 9:00 AM UTC
- Automatic retry on errors (1 hour delay)
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Logs next run time

### 3. **Automated Workflows**

#### **Trial Warning Workflow**
```
Daily check at 9 AM UTC
    ↓
Find trials expiring in 7/3/1 days
    ↓
Check if warning already sent today
    ↓
Send warning notification
    ↓
Log event to database
    ↓
Track metrics
```

**Urgency Levels:**
- 7 days: 📢 Reminder
- 3 days: ⚠️ Important  
- 1 day: 🚨 URGENT

#### **Trial Expiration Workflow**
```
Daily check at 9 AM UTC
    ↓
Find trials expiring today
    ↓
Update subscription status to 'grace_period'
    ↓
Set grace_period_end_date (3 days from now)
    ↓
Update group status to 'grace_period'
    ↓
Send trial expired notification
    ↓
Log event to database
```

#### **Grace Period Warning Workflow**
```
Daily check at 9 AM UTC
    ↓
Find grace periods ending tomorrow
    ↓
Check if warning already sent today
    ↓
Send URGENT grace period warning
    ↓
Log event to database
```

#### **Subscription Expiration Workflow**
```
Daily check at 9 AM UTC
    ↓
Find grace periods expiring today
    ↓
Update subscription status to 'expired'
    ↓
Update group is_active to 0 (DISABLE)
    ↓
Update group status to 'expired'
    ↓
Send subscription expired notification
    ↓
Log event to database
```

## 🧪 Testing

### **Test File:** `test_subscription_checker.py` (276 lines)

**Test Scenarios:**
1. ✅ Trial expiring in 7 days → Warning sent
2. ✅ Trial expiring in 3 days → Warning sent
3. ✅ Trial expiring in 1 day → URGENT warning sent
4. ✅ Trial expiring today → Moved to grace period
5. ✅ Grace period ending in 1 day → URGENT warning sent
6. ✅ Grace period ending today → Subscription expired, group disabled

**Test Results:**
```
